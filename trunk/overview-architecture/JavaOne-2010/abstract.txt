Title: Abstract Mashups for Enterprise Java

Abstract (750 characters)

What do twitter, del.icio.us, YouTube and Google maps all have in
common? 1. they are all crazy popular 2. they all use an architecture
that decouples their front and back ends using a RESTful API. This
session argues that such architectures are a key enabler for the
popularity of these and other similar sites. A unified programming model
that seamlessly integrates disparate endpoints would therefore be very
useful. Audience: programmers who understand the power of mashups but
want an easier way to use them in their work.

* Popular services get that way because they are mashable. 

* Having one programming model for many different services is useful. 

* Here is an example of one such programming model: Mashups4JSF.

A. Logically construct and support arguments for the following points

1. The role mashability plays in the success of online services

2. The difficulties that arise from using disparate mashup providers in
one application

3. Having an unified programming model for disparate mashup providers is
very useful

B. Demonstrate a solution to the problem by using Mashups4JSF to build a
live demo
