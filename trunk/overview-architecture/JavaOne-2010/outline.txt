I. Build the case for mashups edburns

  A. Define mashability

  B. How does mashability influence the success of a venture

    1. For the public

    2. For the enterprise

  C. Case studies

    1. twitter

    2. PENDING: find good example of mashup that is used inside the
    enterprise.

II. Build the case for a unified model, built on industry standards hazems

  A. Is there any kind of unified model?  No.

    There is no unified model for mashup services. Some services are
    using REST while others are using SOAP. Without a unified model,
    clients will have to write a great deal of code to interact with the
    mashup services.

    1. twitter mashup

    2. amazon web services

  B. Let's imagine

    How about building this demo

    Having a master dataTable and a detailed Google Map, a yahoo weather
    indicator, a youTube listing and a twitter listing. When we click on
    the master dataTable row, the location information is shown in the
    detailed Google Map, the weather information in the yahoo weather
    indicator, the tweets done by people in that location, and finally
    the videos uploaded by people in that location.

   Have some slides that show the complexity you would have to mitigate
   to build such a solution.

  B. What could we do if we had a unified programming model?

    Then we build this demo live with Mashups4JSF.

III. Conclusion

  A. Mashups are important

  B. Having a mashup meta-model gives developers a lot of power.

  C. Key ingredients for a mashup meta-model

    * Mashup integration happens on the server

    * There is a declarative syntax for describing the mashup.

      - This syntax includes a suitably powerful component abstraction model

    * There is a powerful programming language that works closely with
      the declarative syntax.

    * Hide the lower level APIs offered by the mashup service providers

    * Having good separation between services eases maintenance
