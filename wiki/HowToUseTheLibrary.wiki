*How to configure the library:*
 * Place the the latest library jar in your web application WEB-INF/lib folder.
 * Include the tag library in your JSF page as follows:
{{{
 <%@ taglib uri="http://code.google.com/p/mashups4jsf/" prefix="m" %>
}}}
  And if you are using Facelets:
{{{
 <html xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"
      xmlns:ui="http://java.sun.com/jsf/facelets"
      xmlns:h="http://java.sun.com/jsf/html"
      xmlns:f="http://java.sun.com/jsf/core"
      xmlns:mashup="http://code.google.com/p/mashups4jsf/">
}}}
 * Done!!!
Note that mashups4jsf does not enforce you to use its components for rendering your mashup, you can directly access the service factory, and make the rendering you wish inside your web application.
